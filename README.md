# fenton
I build stuff that (mostly) works. Say hello@fentonk.com

## What’s here:

- Python scripts that do the boring stuff so you don’t have to.
- Full-stack projects with actual users (shoutout to my mom for beta-testing).
- Rants/learnings about why disaster recovery plans are weirdly satisfying. Check out [my website](https://fentonk.com) for the drama.
