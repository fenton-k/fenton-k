# 👋 Hey, I’m Fenton!
Fresh out of college with a computer science degree. I build stuff that (mostly) works — like road-trip apps, bots that snag you a seat in that impossible class, and websites that don’t look like they’re stuck in 2005.

## What I’m about:

 🛠️ **Fixing real-world headaches:** If it’s tedious (like course registration) or broken, I’ll probably try to automate it.
 
🐍 **(actually useful) Python:** Do I want to talk to your OpenAI Python wrapper chatbot? Probably not. But my Atlas Obscura road-trip planner that finds weird detours? I think that's neat.

☁️ **Cloud nerdery:** I helped convince my college to upgrade from an ancient student information system to Oracle Cloud. Now I’m super into building things that scale.

🚀 ***Agile* vibes:** I like Jira boards, user stories, and pretending I know what a Scrum Master does.

## What’s here:

- Python scripts that do the boring stuff so you don’t have to.
- Full-stack projects with actual users (shoutout to my mom for beta-testing).
- Rants/learnings about why disaster recovery plans are weirdly satisfying. Check out [my website](https://fentonk.com) for the drama.

## Let’s chat!
